                          <h3>1 Fear of Failure</h3>
                            <p> In my experience one of the most common causes of procrastination is a deep-rooted fear of failure.  If you fear the consequences of failing, then a logical extension of this is a disinclination to take action.

This is because you are guaranteed not to fail if you don’t attempt something (although the argument can easily be made that not attempting is the same as failing in the first place – which is an important point to consider).

                          <h3>2 Excessive Perfectionism</h3>
                            <p>Another common cause of procrastination is excessive perfectionism. If you are a self-confessed perfectionist, then you might find it difficult to take action unless you know you can do a job with which you will be totally satisfied.

This becomes a problem when you have to try something new, or different to what you are used to. Because of an ingrained perfectionist mindset, you will either consciously or subconsciously worry about being able to reach an end-state that will be to your liking.</p>

                            <p>Another frequent reason for procrastination is experiencing low energy levels. If you are lacking energy, then it stands to reason that you will not feel like doing much at all.

This is a common cause for those of us with relatively unhealthy lifestyles. Whether you get insufficient sleep to “recharge your batteries”, or your diet causes you to feel sluggish and tired, lifestyle factors can play a huge factor in how inclined you are to get up off the couch and take action.</p>

                            <p>A lack of focus in life is another frequent cause of procrastination. Although some people like to claim that “the person who does not know where they are going always travels further”, this idiom does not mesh well with those of us who are predisposed to procrastination.

You probably have a lack of focus if you frequently feel directionless, or that you do not really have a purpose in life. If you do not have any goals set, then it is almost certain that you will be lacking in focus – as you have no target to work towards. You may simply feel as if you are just drifting through life.

<p>Letting yourself put things off can have greater implications than we may realize. To start, it fosters distress. According to The New Yorker, 65% of students faced with writing a term paper said they would like to avoid procrastinating because they knew the delay would make them unhappy.<br>In addition to the stress and guilt that comes with procrastination, consider these other very real consequences of putting off what you need to do:

Gaining a bad reputation with coworkers, friends, and family.
Losing your ambition to succeed.
Not accomplishing your dreams.
Threatening your well-being if it is a health-related task.

  <p>According to Napoleon Hill, procrastination is “the bad habit of putting of until the day after tomorrow what should have been done the day before yesterday.” Trust me, if you procrastinate now you will panic A LOT later. As Mason Cooley says, “Procrastination makes easy things hard, hard things harder.” Ladies, time management is equivalent to life management so treat your time carefully and avoid procrastination. Here are 5 negative effects of procrastination to remind you how precious your time is.</p>

<p>Procrastination has been extensively studied by psychologists, probably because they have some world-class procrastinators close at hand: students.

Students don’t have a monopoly on wasting time, though, almost everyone procrastinates now and then.

The difference is that people learn effective strategies for dealing with it and get some stuff done; others never do.

Here are ten tips for overcoming procrastination, based on science:</p>

     <h4>Tab 01 Neutralize destructive thinking.</h4>
     <p>When you think of this task, what negative thought pops into your head? Find an antidote to that thought in the form of a truth that contradicts it. For example, if you think “I’ll never be able to learn all this,” you might say to yourself, “If others can learn this, so can I.”</p>

     <h4>Tip 02 Break it down.</h4>
     <p>You’ve envisioned the task, dealt with what’s been holding you back, and fixed your destructive thinking. Now, break the big job down into a series of little doable steps so you can stay focused on just handling the next little task. Plot out each part of the project, including details such as whom you will talk with and what about, where and when you’ll be working, and how long you expect each step to take.</p>

     <h4>Tip 03 Praise each little step.</h4>
     <p>Don’t wait until the end of the task to congratulate yourself. Give yourself praise for each small victory, rewarding yourself for each little step completed. Doing this is very motivating, and it also prevents fear of failure from creeping in to the process and sabotaging your efforts.</p>

<p>Properly managing one's time is critical in overcoming the problem of procrastination. Learning how to manage time is important because of the potentially negatively affect that procrastination can have on various areas of one's life. It is important to understand, however, that procrastination is not a sign of laziness and that it can be caused by several things, in addition to distraction. Regardless of why a person may procrastinate, he or she can take steps to overcome it.</p>
